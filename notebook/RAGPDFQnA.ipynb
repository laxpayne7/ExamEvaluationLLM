She had memories of the 1930s, \\nshe'd seen firsthand what could happen to a country when the world \\neconomy took its gloves off; she'd helped her mother pass out leftovers to \\nhomeless men in the alley behind the ir roominghouse. But disasters of this \\nmagnitude no longer seemed to befall the United States. Safety features had \\nbeen put in place, like the squares of rubber that every modern playground \\nwas paved with, to soften impacts.  \\nNevertheless, the markets did c ollapse, and Enid, who hadn't dreamed that \\nshe would ever be glad that Alfred had locked their assets up in annuities and \\nT-bills, weathered the downturn with less anxiety than her high -flying \\nfriends. Orfic Midland did, as threatened, termi nate her tradi tional health \\ninsurance and force her into an HMO, but her old neighbor Dean Driblett, \\nwith the stroke of a pen, bless his heart, upgraded her and Alfred to \\nDeeDeeCare Choice Plus, which allowed her to keep her favorite doctors. She \\nstill had major non reimbursable monthly nursing -home expenses, but by \\nscrimping she was able to pay the bills with Alfred's pension and Railroad \\nRetirement benefits, and meanwhile her house, which she owned outright, \\ncontin ued to appreciate.

Somehow this truth had eluded her during the years of \\nher anxiety and uncertainty about Alfred, but as soon as he was out of the \\nhouse and she'd caught up on her sleep, she saw it clearly.  \\nShe saw everything more cle arly now, her children in particular.  \\n563\"),\n",
