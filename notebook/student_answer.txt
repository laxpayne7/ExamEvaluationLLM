1. Technological advancements have significantly contributed to globalisation by connecting different parts of the world and facilitating the exchange of goods, services, and information. For example, advancements in transportation technology have made it possible to move goods across long distances quickly and efficiently. This has lowered transportation costs and enabled businesses to expand their markets globally.

2. In democratic systems, there are institutional mechanisms like dialogue, negotiation, and legislation that help in addressing social differences. These mechanisms provide platforms for various social groups to voice their concerns and seek redressal through peaceful means. For instance, in India, the existence of independent bodies like the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes ensures that marginalized communities have a platform to address their grievances and work towards social justice.

3. The rapid advancements in telecommunications, computers, and the internet have transformed the way people communicate and conduct business. Telecommunication facilities like telegraphs, telephones, mobile phones, and fax machines have made it possible for people to connect with one another around the world instantly. The internet has further revolutionized communication by enabling real-time interactions and access to information from anywhere in the world. These developments have facilitated global business operations, remote work, and the exchange of ideas, further driving the globalisation process.

5. In a democracy, the majority is expected to work collaboratively with the minority to ensure that the government represents the interests of all citizens, not just those of the majority. This collaboration helps in building consensus and making decisions that are more inclusive and considerate of diverse perspectives. For example, in Switzerland, the political system ensures representation of both the majority and minority groups, which contributes to a more balanced and inclusive governance structure.
